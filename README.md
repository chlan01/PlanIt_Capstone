## About

PlanIt is a project management web application built using the MERN stack that aims to increase the productivity of primarily teams of developers, and help streamline their workflow process. The software's primary objective is to provide a medium for teams to organize, plan, communicate, and execute their project needs. Finally, PlanIt utilizes kanban boards where teams can setup the workflow for their project tasks with different stages, a team discussion board area, and a team profile area where team members can browse other team member profiles and find information about them.
