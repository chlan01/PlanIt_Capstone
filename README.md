## About

PlanIt is a project management web application that aims to increase the productivity of primarily teams of developers, and help streamline their workflow process. The software's primary objective is to provide a medium for teams to organize, plan, communicate, and execute their project needs. Finally, PlanIt utilizes kanban boards where teams can setup the workflow for their project tasks with different stages, a team discussion board area, and a team profile area where team members can browse other team member profiles and find information about them.
